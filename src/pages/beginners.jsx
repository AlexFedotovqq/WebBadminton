                  Badminton racket weight
                </li>
                <p>
                  Badminton rackets weigh between 54 and 94 grams. The weight of
                  a badminton racket is indicated by the Latin letter “U” and a
                  number. The marking is usually indicated on the cap. As you
                  can see from the table, the lower the number, the heavier the
                  racket, for example, a 3U racket is heavier than a 4U racket.
                </p>

                <p>
                  We recommend adhering to the following principles: A heavier
                  badminton racquet will give you more power, while a lighter
                  one will give you more maneuverability. A feature of heavy
                  badminton rackets is that it is more difficult to make
                  technically accurate strikes with them. Also, a heavy racket
                  can cause fatigue in the hand during prolonged intense play.
                  There are training rackets weighing more than 100 grams. These
                  badminton rackets are designed to train the muscles of the
                  wrist and forearm. badminton racket handle size Rackets differ
                  not only in weight, but also in the size of the handle. The
                  handle size of a badminton racket is indicated by the letter
                  &quot;G&quot; and a number. There are 6 racket sizes: G1 - G6.
                  The smaller the number, the larger the handle. The handle size
                  is usually listed on the racquet cap in combination with the
                  racquet weight, such as 3UG4. Most racquets are made in G4 and
                  G5 handle sizes. If you are not sure what size badminton
                  handle you need, we recommend getting a racquet with a thinner
                  handle, as you can always add extra grip to increase the size.
                  Winding on the racket (grip) is also used to provide a better
                  grip on the racket. Often, when buying a new racket, the flu
                  is immediately wound.

                  Badminton racket balance
                </li>
                <p>
                  The balance of a racket, or the balance of a racket, is
                  determined by the distribution of the mass of the racket
                  between its head and handle. Depending on the balance, there
                  are three categories of badminton rackets. Head-Heavy
                  badminton rackets: Head-Heavy badminton rackets are designed
                  for players who prefer an attacking style of play.
                </p>

                <p>
                  With such a racket, the center of gravity is shifted to the
                  rim of the racket, which contributes to an increase in the
                  force of impacts and a greater attack efficiency. At the same
                  time, with a head-balanced racket, it is more difficult to
                  play defense due to less control of maneuverability and it is
                  more difficult to make a quick exchange of blows. If you are
                  an experienced player with good technique and prefer an
                  attacking style, we recommend that you purchase a Head-Heavy
                  badminton racquet. Badminton rackets with neutral balance
                  (Even-Balance): The Even-Balance badminton racket is a
                  versatile tool for playing a wide variety of games.The neutral
                  balance of the racket, i.e. the even distribution of its mass
                  between the head and the handle provides the badminton player
                  with a combination of high punching power, optimal
                  maneuverability and accuracy. If you play both doubles and
                  singles, practice both attacking and defensive playing styles,
                  we advise you to purchase an Even-Balance badminton racquet.
                  Badminton rackets with handle balance (Head-Light): Head-Light
                  badminton racquets are more intended for athletes who play
                  mainly in doubles and / or prefer a defensive style of play.
                  The Head-Light badminton racquet has a center of gravity
                  shifted towards the handle, which makes it much easier to
                  maneuver with such a racquet when exchanging blows quickly.
                  This is very important when playing defense and playing on the
                  net. At the same time, in order to carry out a powerful
                  attacking Head-Light hit with a badminton racket, the player
                  must have excellent technique, because. it is more difficult
                  to provide a strong blow with such a racket than with a racket
                  balanced to the head.

                  The stiffness of a badminton racquet&apos;s shaft determines
                  the amount of control the racquet has during play.
                  Manufacturers of badminton rackets implement four types of
                  racket stiffness: Highly flexible Flexible Medium Stiff When
                  choosing a racket, you should rely on the physical strength of
                  your wrist and your sports experience and level of training. A
                  stiff racquet has more impact energy potential, provides more
                  control and impact power, but only players with a fast and
                  strong hand can unleash it. If the athlete&apos;s hand
                  physical characteristics, playing experience, and training
                  level are more of a beginner or intermediate level, a hard and
                  very hard racket will be less effective in hitting hard. A
                  flexible racquet is less demanding on the athlete&apos;s
                  technique and fitness, but such a racquet will generate less
                  power on impact, reducing control. The material from which the

                  If you are planning to play all the time or are purchasing a
                  racket for a badminton player who trains on a regular basis,
                  we recommend purchasing only rackets made from
                  graphite,because other materials have certain disadvantages.
                  For example, metal racquets are easily deformed by the rim
                  (from string tension or impact), and the racquet may need to
                  be replaced quickly.

                  Therefore, even if you are a beginner and are buying your
                  first badminton racquet (or planning to get a racquet as a
                  gift), we recommend purchasing a graphite racquet as the most
                  reliable and durable option. If you purchase a racket for
                  occasional, infrequent outdoor games, rackets made from other
                  materials will be a good option for you. Most likely, you will
                  not feel a big difference in quality, but you can save money.
                  Results: A well-trained athlete will suit Stiff and Medium
                  racquets. If you have an attacking style, you should choose a
                  head-heavy racquet. If you have a defensive playing style, you
                  should choose a racket with a balance in the handle
                  (Head-Light), and for a mixed style of play, a racket with a
                  neutral balance (Even-Balance) is suitable. Highly flexible
                  and flexible rackets are suitable for beginner athletes.
